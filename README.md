Diary:
20.01 - Created the function to make dictionary out of dataset. 
        Maybe try not to use the .readlines function
21.01 - Started thinking about what my output should look like, created dictionary relating aminoacid to its number. *think about map function as easier solution.
        Mostly reading stuff related to pandas, Scikit, SVM which is necessary to finish the praser.
        Try to use with open to make code shorter(def filetodictionary).
