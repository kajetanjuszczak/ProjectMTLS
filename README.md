Diary:
* 20.01
    * Created the function to make dictionary out of dataset.
    * Maybe try not to use the .readlines function
* 21.01
    * Started thinking about what my output should look like, created dictionary relating aminoacid to its number. *think about map function as easier solution.
    * Mostly reading stuff related to pandas, Scikit, SVM which is necessary to finish the parser.
    * Try to use with open to make code shorter(def filetodictionary).
    * My parser is now returning amino acid sequence and state in as list of numbers
